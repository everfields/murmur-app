# Working on this repo

Read this before changing anything. It is written for a coding agent picking the project up
cold, and it is mostly a list of things that look wrong but aren't, plus things that look
fine and will bite you.

## What this is

Push-to-talk dictation. Hold a key, talk, release, and cleaned-up text is typed into
whatever had focus. Two independent implementations:

| | macOS | Windows |
|---|---|---|
| Language | Swift 6 | C# / .NET 10 |
| UI | SwiftUI | Avalonia |
| Speech | Apple `SpeechAnalyzer`, or Parakeet via FluidAudio | Parakeet v3 (multilingual) via sherpa-onnx |
| Location | repo root | `windows/` |

**The macOS app works and is in daily use.**

**The Windows app runs on real Windows hardware, but nobody has dictated with it yet.** On a
physical machine — Lenovo ThinkPad, Core Ultra 7 165H, 32 GB RAM, Windows 11 build 26100,
x64, .NET SDK 10.0.204 — the whole solution including `Murmur.Platform.Windows` builds at
zero warnings with `-warnaserror`, `dotnet test Murmur.sln` is 112 passed / 0 failed,
`--selftest` reports all 11 checks ok against the real platform layer, and Parakeet
transcribes the model's English, Spanish, French and German test clips correctly. What has
still never happened is a person holding the key and speaking into a microphone. Describe it
that way — not as "working", not as "unfinished", and **not** as "never run on real
hardware", which was true until this was measured and is now wrong.

---

## The one rule that matters

**`shared/dictionary-test-vectors.json` is the specification for correction behaviour.**

Both implementations run it in CI. If you change how corrections work, change the vectors
first, watch both sides go red, then make them green. Changing one implementation to "fix"
a failing vector without changing the other is how the two silently diverge — and only one
of them can be exercised by hand.

```bash
swift test --filter VectorTests                    # macOS side
cd windows && dotnet test Murmur.CrossPlatform.slnf # Windows side, runs anywhere
```

The Swift copy at `Tests/MurmurDictionaryTests/dictionary-test-vectors.json` is a copy, and
CI fails if it drifts from `shared/`. After editing the shared file:

```bash
cp shared/dictionary-test-vectors.json Tests/MurmurDictionaryTests/
```

---

## Things that look like bugs and are not

**`dotnet build Murmur.sln` fails on macOS** with `NETSDK1073`. Expected —
`Murmur.Platform.Windows` targets `net10.0-windows`. Use `Murmur.CrossPlatform.slnf`, which
omits it; everything else, including the whole UI suite, builds and tests on macOS in about
half a second.

**`swift build` fails with "input file was modified during the build."** The repo lives in an
iCloud-synced folder and the sync engine touches files mid-compile. **Always build with
`make`**, which uses `--scratch-path` outside the synced tree. A bare `swift build` also
writes a `.build/` directory into iCloud, which makes every subsequent build minutes slower.
If you see this error, wait a few seconds and retry.

**Compare mode doesn't type anything.** By design — `Settings.compareMode` runs every engine
on one recording and shows them side by side. If both injected, two transcripts would fight
over one text field. This is the single most confusing behaviour in the app.

**The timing column isn't comparing like with like.** Apple and Parakeet are timed on local
compute with the clock started *after* model load. Wispr Flow's number is its own
`e2eLatency`, which includes a network round trip and its cleanup pass. Don't present them
as one ranking.

**`MainActor.assumeIsolated` will crash the process.** It does not check the claim, it
asserts it. Use `await MainActor.run` from any non-main-actor context. This took the app
down once already.

**Mutating `@State` inside a `Canvas` draw closure floods the log and corrupts state.** The
VU meter keeps its needle physics in a plain reference type the view merely holds, which is
invisible to SwiftUI's state graph. Don't "clean that up" into `@State`.

---

## Design system

`Sources/MurmurYouTube/UI/DesignSystem.swift` defines every colour, size, radius, duration
and material token. **Views must not contain literal values.** If a component needs a number
that isn't a token, add the token rather than inlining it.

The direction is 1980s field recorders — Sony TC-D5, Marantz PMD, Nakamichi, Braun. Silver
face in light appearance, black face in dark. Two rules that are not negotiable:

- **Red means recording.** Nothing else in the app is red.
- **Amber and green are instrumentation only** — level meters, never UI chrome.

Explicitly ruled out: neon, vaporwave, synthwave, purple/pink gradients, glowing text, chrome
lettering, grid horizons. There are **no gradients anywhere**; depth comes from flat panels,
hairline bevels and procedurally-drawn brushed grain.

---

## macOS specifics

**Code signing is load-bearing, not cosmetic.** TCC stores a code-signing *requirement* per
entry, not just a path. An ad-hoc signature changes every build, so the rebuilt binary stops
satisfying the stored requirement — and the symptom lies: the Accessibility toggle still
shows as **on** while the app is untrusted. The `Makefile` auto-detects a Developer ID via
`security find-identity`. Don't replace that with `--sign -`.

If a grant does get wedged, reset that one row — never toggle, and never omit the bundle ID:

```bash
tccutil reset Accessibility ai.pivotstudio.murmur-youtube
```

A bare `tccutil reset Accessibility` wipes every app on the machine. Then quit System
Settings entirely (⌘Q) before reopening; the Privacy pane caches its list.

**`log` may be shadowed in the user's shell.** Use `/usr/bin/log` explicitly.

**Don't run the `.app` from the repo folder.** It's iCloud-synced and the sync engine can
corrupt the signature. `make install` puts the running copy in `/Applications`.

---

## Windows specifics

The specifics below were expensive to establish and several were found the hard way. Treat
them as load-bearing. Full detail in `windows/README.md` and `docs/PARAKEET-WINDOWS.md`.

**Three pinned versions that break silently at "latest":**

| Package | Pin | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `NAudio` | 2.3.0 | 3.x targets .NET 9+ and will not restore |
| `Avalonia.Headless.XUnit` | 11.3.20 | 12.x requires xUnit **v3**, a different package line |
| `org.k2fsa.sherpa.onnx` | 1.13.5 | Bundles ONNX Runtime — never also reference `Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime` |

**Windows ships with no push-to-talk key at all.** Right Shift was the default and had to be
withdrawn — it is a primary typing key, so dictation fired on capital letters. Recording is
started from the app (RECORD, or the tray) until a key is chosen for a better reason than
"it was free". `PushToTalkKeys.Sanitize` maps a stored Right Shift to off on load, so an old
`settings.json` cannot keep triggering. Off installs no `WH_KEYBOARD_LL` hook at all.

**Right Alt is AltGr** on German, Polish, UK, Nordic and most Latin-American layouts. Binding
push-to-talk there — and especially suppressing it — breaks typing `@`, `€`, `\`, `|` for
those users. Right Ctrl is the safest real key, and the hook **observes without swallowing**:
if the key-down is swallowed and the key-up escapes, the target app believes Ctrl is held
forever.

**The model is multilingual and the search order encodes that.** The app looks for
`models\parakeet-v3\` — 25 European languages, Spanish included — before falling back to
`models\parakeet-v2\`, English-only, and it checks `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Murmur\` before the app
folder for each. Variant-major on purpose: a stale English-only copy beside the executable
must not shadow a multilingual one the user just installed. There is **no language setting**
anywhere; the model identifies the language itself, and the sherpa-onnx configuration is
identical for both variants. Don't add a locale field. Download routes — including a GitHub
mirror for networks that block `huggingface.co` — are in `docs/PARAKEET-WINDOWS.md`.

**Performance numbers in old comments are wrong.** Measured on a Core Ultra 7 165H with v3
int8: **6–8× real time**, not 40×; **~725 MB resident**, not ~2 GB; **7.5–10 s model load**,
not 2 s. Threads: 4–8 is a plateau, 12 and 16 are much worse, so the shipped 4 stays. If you
find "40×", "2 GB" or "eight measured slower than four" anywhere, it is stale — the measured
figures live in `docs/PARAKEET-WINDOWS.md`.

**UI Automation cannot inject text.** `TextPattern` is documented read-only and
`ValuePattern` replaces a whole field rather than inserting at the caret. `SendInput` is the
primary path, not a fallback.

**`Murmur.App` loads the platform layer by reflection, not by reference.** A direct
reference would force the UI onto `net10.0-windows` and you would lose the ability to run it
on your own machine. Two consequences that have already bitten once: the assembly is
invisible to `PublishSingleFile`, so it is published as a loose file beside the exe *and*
resolved by an explicit `AssemblyLoadContext` handler; and the published self-test checks
this, because when it breaks the app starts perfectly and then does nothing at all when the
key is pressed.

**Keep `Murmur.Platform.Windows` logic-free.** Anything living there is code CI cannot
exercise. Retries, debouncing and device-change handling belong in the platform-neutral
projects behind an interface — those target plain `net10.0`, so `CA1416` turns any accidental
Win32 call into a build error.

**CI is the only place the Windows code is compiled.** Warnings are errors and the analyzers
are strict on purpose. `--no-incremental` is mandatory: Roslyn does not re-emit analyzer
warnings on a cached build, so without it the gate proves nothing.

## Regex, if you touch the dictionary

The two engines are not identical. Measured across 30 cases, **9 diverged**. Two affect this
code and are handled — don't remove either:

- `RegexOptions.CultureInvariant` on the C# side, or Turkish `İ` matches `i`.
- **NFC normalization on both sides.** macOS returns decomposed strings, so without it an
  accented trigger silently never fires.

Two more are unfixable and simply avoided: ICU folds `ß` to `ss` and .NET doesn't; .NET's `.`
splits surrogate pairs. Stay inside the safe subset — `\b`, `\d`, `\w`, `\s`, character
classes, greedy/lazy quantifiers, alternation, `(?<name>…)`, fixed-length lookbehind,
lookahead, `\p{L}`, and `$1`–`$9` in replacements. Nothing else.

---

## What isn't built

1. **Command Mode** — select text, hold a second key, "make this more formal."
2. **Onboarding** — a first-run window walking through the macOS permissions.
3. **Notarization** (macOS) and **code signing** (Windows). Both apps are unsigned for
   distribution, so Windows users will meet SmartScreen.
4. **An installer** for Windows, and model download from inside the app rather than by
   following `docs/PARAKEET-WINDOWS.md` by hand.

## What no amount of CI can verify

On Windows, nobody has yet held the key and spoken. Build, tests, `--selftest` and
file-based transcription are all now verified on a real machine; these are not:

- Text injection landing in a foreground app — runners have an interactive desktop but
  cannot take the foreground.
- A real microphone: format negotiation, the OS privacy block, unplugging mid-capture.
  Parakeet is verified on WAV files, not on live capture.
- The keyboard hook firing on a physical keypress.

Everything those feed into is behind an interface and tested with fakes, and `--selftest`
confirms each binding constructs. Constructing is not using. **The remaining step is a single
short spoken dictation into Notepad.**
